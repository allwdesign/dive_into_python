Task 2. A triangle only exists if the sum of any two of its sides is greater than third. Given a, b, c - the sides of the proposed triangle.
It is required to compare the length of each segment-side with the sum of the other two. If in at least one case the segment is greater than the sum of the other two,
then a triangle with such sides does not exist.
Separately report whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles or equilateral.

Task 3. Write code that asks for a number and tells if it's prime or composite. Use the rule to check: â€œA number is prime if is only divisible by 1 and itself.
